# Agent Model Configuration
# 
# This file defines which LLM model each agent should use.
# 
# Strategy:
# - Senior Auditors: GPT-5 for sophisticated reasoning and judgment
# - Staff Auditors: GPT-4 Turbo for cost-effective routine tasks
# - Audit Manager: GPT-4 Turbo for reviews and approvals
#
# Cost Optimization:
# - GPT-5: $15/1M input tokens, $45/1M output tokens
# - GPT-4 Turbo: $10/1M input tokens, $30/1M output tokens
# - Estimated 30-40% cost savings vs all GPT-5

# LLM Provider Settings
provider: openai  # Options: openai, anthropic, ollama
rate_limit: 10    # Max API calls per minute
temperature: 0.7  # Sampling temperature (0.0-1.0)
