# Audit Planning Guide

## Purpose
This guide helps the audit manager create a comprehensive audit plan based on the approved risk assessment.

## Procedure Steps

### 1. Review Approved Risk Assessment
- Confirm risk assessment has been approved
- Review prioritized list of high-risk controls
- Understand scope and any limitations
- Note any special requests from management

### 2. Select Controls to Test
Based on risk assessment, select controls from ISACA audit program:
- Include all Critical and High risk controls
- Sample Medium risk controls for coverage
- Consider Low risk controls only if time permits
- Ensure balanced coverage across domains

### 3. Extract Testing Steps
For each selected control:
- Review ISACA control objective
- Extract specific testing procedures
- Identify required evidence types
- Note any special testing considerations

### 4. Assign Controls to Auditors
Consider these factors when assigning:
- **Senior Auditors** (Esther, Chuck, Victor):
  - Complex controls requiring judgment
  - Controls with significant findings risk
  - Controls requiring interviews
  - First-time control testing
  
- **Staff Auditors** (Hillel, Neil, Juman):
  - Straightforward evidence collection
  - Routine control testing
  - Support work for senior auditors
  - Documentation and workpaper preparation

### 5. Estimate Audit Hours
Use these guidelines:
- **Risk Assessment**: 8-16 hours
- **Audit Planning**: 4-8 hours
- **Control Testing** (per control):
  - Simple controls: 2-4 hours
  - Moderate controls: 4-8 hours
  - Complex controls: 8-16 hours
- **Reporting**: 8-16 hours
- **Review & QA**: 10-20% of total hours

### 6. Create Audit Timeline
- Set start and end dates
- Define milestones (fieldwork, draft report, final report)
- Allow buffer time for unexpected issues
- Coordinate with client availability

### 7. Document Audit Plan
Create an audit plan document that includes:
- Audit objectives and scope
- List of controls to be tested
- Testing procedures for each control
- Assignment of controls to auditors
- Estimated hours by auditor
- Timeline and milestones
- Reporting deliverables

### 8. Communicate Plan to Team
- Hold kickoff meeting with audit team
- Explain risk assessment findings
- Review control assignments
- Answer questions and clarify expectations
- Ensure everyone understands their role

### 9. Obtain Approval
- Present audit plan to audit committee
- Get management sign-off
- Document any changes or adjustments
- Communicate approved plan to team
