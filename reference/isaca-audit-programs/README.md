# ISACA AWS Audit Programs

This folder contains the ISACA AWS Audit Program CSV files (2022 version) that serve as the foundation for the audit procedures in this project.

## Files

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Asset Management.csv** - Asset management control objectives and procedures
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Audit insturctions.csv** - General audit instructions and methodology
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) dataencryption.csv** - Data encryption control objectives and procedures
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) disasterrecovery.csv** - Disaster recovery control objectives and procedures
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Governance.csv** - Governance control objectives and procedures
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) incidentresponse.csv** - Incident response control objectives and procedures
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) logging.csv** - Logging control objectives and procedures
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) logging2.csv** - Additional logging control objectives and procedures
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) logicalaccess.csv** - Logical access control objectives and procedures
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Network.csv** - Network security control objectives and procedures

## Purpose

These CSV files contain the traditional ISACA audit procedures that the AWS Audit Agent System will:

1. **Execute automatically** using autonomous agents
2. **Modernize** by identifying automation opportunities
3. **Enhance** with AI-powered analysis capabilities
4. **Compare** against 2025 best practices

## Control Domains

The audit programs cover the following ISACA control domains:

- **Governance** - Overall AWS governance and management
- **Logical Access** - IAM, authentication, authorization
- **Data Encryption** - Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Network** - VPC, security groups, network controls
- **Logging** - CloudTrail, CloudWatch, audit logging
- **Incident Response** - Security incident handling
- **Disaster Recovery** - Backup, recovery, business continuity
- **Asset Management** - Resource inventory and tracking

## Usage in the Project

The audit agents will:

1. Load these CSV files to understand ISACA control objectives
2. Map control objectives to AWS services and APIs
3. Execute testing procedures automatically
4. Generate findings based on control criteria
5. Produce modernization recommendations for ISACA

## Source

These audit programs are based on the ISACA AWS Audit Program (2022 version), which provides a comprehensive framework for auditing AWS environments.

## Note

The project aims to demonstrate how autonomous agents can execute these traditional audit procedures more efficiently while maintaining professional audit standards.
