Maintaining the Plan,,The enterprise ensures that there is clear understanding across the organization regarding strategy and plan of action in the event of a security event.,"Security incident response documentation is continuously updated as the enterprise evolves. Management reviews the security incident response on a predetermined basis or as needed, following operational changes.",,,,"1. Interview responsible and/or accountable individuals (security, infrastructure, executive management, etc.) to determine the specific security incident response documentation that is in scope for review and the frequency of review.
2. Inquire about methods for providing input to security incident response documentation. Understand which specific individuals provide input to the security incident response process, including those who must approve any changes or updates.
3. Obtain and inspect security incident policies, plans and procedures, and determine whether they:
• Require documentation of a review by appropriate individuals
• Have been reviewed within the timeframe stipulated by the enterprise
• Include a summary of policy/plan/procedure changes (if any)",,,,
Practicing the Plan,,,The enterprise prepares for security threats through a variety of simulated exercises. The enterprise schedules security table top exercises on a frequency predetermined by the enterprise to improve security incident response capabilities.,,,,"1. Interview responsible and/or accountable individuals (security, legal, etc.) to determine the:
• Frequency of incident response practice scenarios conducted by the enterprise
• Personnel involved
• Scenarios practiced in relation to company operations and utilized technology
2. Obtain and inspect summary exercise reports, meeting minutes or updates to the security incident response plan resulting from tabletop exercises.",,,,
Crisis Communications,,The enterprise expressly considers and incorporates public relations into its security posture and documentation.,"The enterprise has developed crisis-communication procedures that inform personnel how to report security breaches to regulators, law enforcement or customers, if necessary.

Note: The enterprise should know when, how and to whom it should report security incidents (whether short-lived or prolonged). A single poorly managed security incident can put the company out of business or permanently harm its reputation. Crisis communication procedures that are reviewed and practiced over time may help reduce the risk.",,,,"1. Interview responsible and/or accountable individuals (security, legal, operations management, etc.) to determine whether security incident response policies, plans or procedures inform the enterprise:
• How to identify and declare a formal crisis within the enterprise (e.g., if a security breach leads to millions of exposed PII records)
• Which individuals must be included in crisis communications and how to contact them, responsibilities of other individuals across the enterprise
• What approaches and requirements are necessary when speaking with the media (this may be needed for standard employees as well)
• What approaches and requirements are necessary when communicating crisis information to authorities
• What approaches and requirements are necessary when communicating crisis impacts to customers or internal employees (as appropriate)
2. Obtain and inspect security policies, plans and procedures, and determine whether they define and/or contain appendices describing how enterprisewide security crises should be handled.
3. Inspect the crisis communications to determine whether they are routinely reviewed for completeness and accuracy.",,,,
"Enterprisewide Visibility
Through Automation",,The enterprise ensures effectiveness of its security incident response program through strategic communication.,Enterprise security personnel are informed about security events of interest in a timely manner. The enterprise has deployed a security information and event monitoring (SIEM) capability to report potential security events to appropriate personnel.,,,,"1. Interview responsible and/or accountable individuals to determine which security tools (e.g., firewalls, IDS, IPS, antivirus, etc.), and event types from these tools, are feeding into the security event information management (SIEM) tool. 
2. Inquire about:
• The required or intended recipients of alerts generated by the SIEM
• How maintenance of SIEM event monitoring is performed to update and include new event sources or remove old event sources
• How event correlation between different sources is performed and achieved
• How false positives, false negatives and other noise are reduced
2. Obtain documentation of the population of event sources and types managed by the SIEM. Through observation and judgmental sampling, determine whether alerting capabilities function as intended and inform the appropriate personnel. 
3. Obtain and inspect completed maintenance reports or communications illustrating the enterprise's attempts to keep the SIEM in an optimal state.",,,,
"Centralized & Secured Storage
of Security Events",,The enterprise maintains integrity over security events by utilizing a secure incident handling application.,"Enterprise security incidents are maintained within the application defined by the enterprise and are retained for the period of time determined by the enterprise. 

Note: It is not uncommon for certain phases of a security incident to be handled in different applications or network directories. For example, the security incident may be initially documented, investigated and eradicated in the enterprise's help desk ticketing system (e.g., ServiceNow®, Remedy®, etc.), and then investigated for root cause, using less formal means outside of that system (e.g., via meetings, word documents and reports stored in secured network directories). This may be done to keep the details of a security breach suppressed for security purposes or until necessary details of the incident are known.",,,,"1. Interview responsible and/or accountable individuals (security, infrastructure, etc.) to determine the applications or mechanisms employed by the enterprise to document investigation, resolution and lessons-learned activities resulting from security events.
2. Inquire about:
• Reported events or network alerts that should drive creation of security incidents in the enterprise-designated application
• Individuals with read and modify access to security incident information and how appropriateness of access is determined 
• Level of required detail recorded for security events (enterprises may use obscure code words to internally communicate that security events have occurred, or are occurring, and may require that minimal details be recorded in security incident tickets)
• Retention requirements for security incidents and how deletion of records occurs or is triggered
• Personnel access to security incidents and how routinely access is reviewed to ensure that it remains appropriate
3. Obtain and inspect management review of access listings to security incident applications or other network sources and inquire with management on appropriateness of access, if necessary
4. Document the population of security events and incidents that have occurred in the period under review. 
5. Through judgmental sampling, obtain and review security incident tickets to determine whether:
• Security incidents were appropriately generated or opened for security events reported
• Appropriate detail is contained in the security incidents as required by the enterprise (e.g., title, reporter, date, status, etc.)
• Deletion of archived security incidents is occurring as required by the enterprise",,,,
"Communicating
with External Enterprises",,"To ensure that the enterprise is aware of security events of interest, the enterprise collaborates with external business partners (law enforcement, vendors, etc.).","The enterprise has appropriate contact information for external business partners. On a periodical basis, the enterprise reviews and communicates necessary contact information modifications to external business partners.

Note: External entities should know who to contact if it is externally discovered that a security breach is or may be affecting the enterprise.",,,,"1. Interview responsible and/or accountable individuals to determine which external parties the enterprise provides security contact information to, along with alternative enterprise contacts, how the information is provided to external parties and how often contact information is updated then shared.
2. Obtain and inspect crisis communication plans, security documentation or update communications sent to required external contacts, to determine if valid information is available for security event reporting purposes.
From the AWS Management Console, in the AWS Navigation menu:
a) Click on the ""Account Name"" logged into the AWS account.
b) Click ""My Account"".
c) Inspect the ""Alternate Contacts"" section.
d) Under the ""Security"" field, ensure appropriate enterprise contact details are populated.*

"Creating Roles to Manage
AWS Incidents
",,The enterprise ensures that there is role-specific plan of action in the event of a security event.,"The enterprise creates appropriate access roles for external AWS support personnel assisting with security incidents. The enterprise has created an AWS Support role and managed policies that limit access to AWS applications.

Note: If the enterprise has a paid support plan with AWS, an IAM access role should be created and managed that provides only the necessary access for AWS support personnel to access the environment. This may be limited to incident response assistance or other support defined by the enterprise",,,,"1. Interview responsible and/or accountable individuals (operations management, security , etc.) to determine the number of IAM roles that exist to provide external support personnel access to the environment and the access permissions granted to each role.
2. Inquire about:
• Frequency of review for AWS Support roles and related permissions
• Users in the enterprise that can create or modify AWS Support roles 
• Level of monitoring in place that detects and informs the enterprise when AWS Support roles are used, created or modified
3. Obtain and inspect AWS Command Line Interface output that filters for the ""AWSSupportAccess"" managed policy value (aws iam list-policies --query ""Policies[?Policy Name == 'AWSSupportAccess']"").
4. Determine which users, groups or roles the policy is attached to and whether this is appropriate. Appropriateness can be determined through inspection of the associated Amazon Resource Names (ARN) that the policy attaches to (aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn <iam_policy_arn>).
5. Inspect each managed policy for appropriateness of permissions detailed in the policy statements",,,,
